# Nike_Assistant

This program is made for my Interaction Design class.
This is a prototype of a chatbot that can help you navigate the Nike website.
The code is written in python and uses multiple libraries.
These are the libraries I used:
Tkinter
Threading
Time
BeatuifulSoup
PIL
textwrap
speech_recognition
pyttsx3
